# Into to the tidyverse

This introduction to the [tidiverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is parte of the [R Summer School](http://rsummer.data-analysis.at/) in Vorau 2017. 

It is split in two parts:

  * First: Introduction to the tidyverse (mainly dplyr)
  * Second: Introduction to web-scraping via rvest
